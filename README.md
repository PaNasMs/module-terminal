# OstojaOS Terminal module

Interactive system-user terminal with administrator permission checks.

Standalone source repository. Requires OstojaOS core `>=0.2.0,<0.3.0`, module API 1.
Frontend: React / TypeScript. Server: Go with the versioned module SDK.
Python helpers run through the host management interface where applicable.

## Build and release

On ARM64 Linux install Node.js 24, Go 1.26+, Python 3, gcc and libpam0g-dev.
Run `sh scripts/build.sh`. The result is an **unsigned build payload** in dist.
The registry signs it separately; unsigned payloads cannot be installed directly.

Update manifest.json and package.json versions, commit and push a matching `vX.Y.Z`
tag. CI tests and builds the source and publishes an immutable GitHub Release.
OstojaOS/module-registry periodically imports official releases, signs installable
archives and publishes them in the catalog. No signing key is available here.
Never replace a published version; issue a new patch version instead.
